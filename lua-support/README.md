Lua-IDE for Vim/gVim. It is written to considerably speed up writing code in
a consistent style. This is done by inserting complete statements, idioms and
comments. These code fragments are provided in an extendible template library.
This plug-in helps with running and compiling Lua scripts, applying the code
checker, and provides quick access to the online documentation of the Lua
functions.
Please read the documentation.
This plug-in can be used with Vim version 7.x .

Lua is: Copyright 1994â€“2014 Lua.org, PUC-Rio.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  INSTALLATION
================================================================================

A system-wide installation for all users can also be done. This will have
further effects on how the plug-in works. For a step-by-step instruction, as
well as an explanation of the other consequences, please see the help file
'doc/luasupport.txt' or look up the documentation via:

      :help luasupport-system-wide

  (1) LINUX
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive lua-support.zip mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory

      $HOME/.vim/

(find the value of $HOME with ":echo $HOME" from inside Vim).

(1.0) Save the template files in '$HOME/.vim/lua-support/templates/' if
   you have changed any of them.

(1.1) Copy the zip archive lua-support.zip to $HOME/.vim and run

      unzip lua-support.zip

(1.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/.vimrc'. Create one if there
   is none or use the file in $HOME/.vim/lua-support/rc as a starting point.

(1.3) Set at least some personal details in the file

      '$HOME/.vim/lua-support/templates/Templates'

   Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

       SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',       'Wolfgang Mehner' )
       SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',    'WM' )
       SetMacro( 'EMAIL',        'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
       SetMacro( 'ORGANIZATION', '' )
       SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',    'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(1.4) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME/.vim/doc/

(1.5) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/.vimrc'. The files
   customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or extensions
   for your .vimrc and .gvimrc. You may want to use parts of them. The files
   are documented.

  (2) WINDOWS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The subdirectories in the zip archive lua-support.zip mirror the directory
structure which is needed below the local installation directory

      $HOME/vimfiles/

(find the value of $HOME with ":echo $HOME" from inside Vim).

(2.0) Save the template files in '$HOME/vimfiles/lua-support/templates/'
   if you have changed any of them.

(2.1) Copy the zip archive lua-support.zip to $HOME/vimfiles and run

      unzip lua-support.zip

(2.2) Loading of plug-in files must be enabled. If not use

      :filetype plugin on

   This is the minimal content of the file '$HOME/_vimrc'. Create one if there
   is none or use the file in $HOME/vimfiles/lua-support/rc as a starting
   point.

(2.3) Set at least some personal details in the file

      '$HOME/vimfiles/lua-support/templates/Templates'

   Here is the minimal personalization (my settings as an example):

       SetMacro( 'AUTHOR',       'Wolfgang Mehner' )
       SetMacro( 'AUTHORREF',    'WM' )
       SetMacro( 'EMAIL',        'wolfgang-mehner@web.de' )
       SetMacro( 'ORGANIZATION', '' )
       SetMacro( 'COPYRIGHT',    'Copyright (c) |YEAR|, |AUTHOR|' )

   (Read more about the template system in the plug-in documentation)

(2.4) Make the plug-in help accessible by typing the following command on the
   Vim command line:

      :helptags $HOME\vimfiles\doc\

(2.5) Consider additional settings in the file '$HOME/_vimrc'. The files
   customization.vimrc and customization.gvimrc are replacements or extensions
   for your _vimrc and _gvimrc. You may want to use parts of them. The files
   are documented.

  (3) ADDITIONAL REMARKS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a lot of features and options which can be used and influenced:

  *  use of the extendible template library
  *  automated generation of comments for functions
  *  use of the Lua interpreter, compiler and code checker
  *  quick access to the online documentation
  *  removing the Lua menu

Look at the Lua-Support help with:

      :help luasupport

  ADDITIONAL TIPS
================================================================================

(1) You may want to use a central hidden directory for all your backup files:

   1.1 Add the following line to .vimrc:

      set backupdir=$HOME/.vim.backupdir

   1.2 Create  $HOME/.vim.backupdir  .

   1.3 Add the following line to your shell initialization file  ~/.profile :

      find $HOME/.vim.backupdir/  -name "*" -type f -mtime +60 -exec rm -f {} \;

   When you are logging in all files in the backup directory older then 60
   days (-mtime +60) will be removed (60 days is a suggestion, of course).
   Be sure to backup in shorter terms !

(2) gVim. Toggle 'insert mode' <--> 'normal mode' with the right mouse button
   (see mapping in file customization.gvimrc).

(3) gVim. Use tear off menus.

(4) Try 'Focus under mouse' as window behavior (No mouse click when the mouse
   pointer is back from the menu entry).

(5) Use Emulate3Buttons "on" (X11) even for a 3-button mouse. Pressing left and
   right button simultaneously without moving your fingers is faster than
   moving a finger to the middle button (which is often a wheel).
